## Introduction

Welcome to the Faculty of Engineering Room Reservation System!

This platform has been developed to streamline and simplify the process of booking lecture rooms within the Faculty of Engineering. As part of the Engineering Education Unit, the system aims to address the challenges associated with manual room bookings, which often result in scheduling conflicts and confusion. By providing a more efficient, digital solution, we hope to create a seamless experience for lecturers and academic staff.

The system offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface designed to resemble Google Calendar, making it easy for users to navigate and manage their room reservations. Lecturers and academic staff can quickly book rooms either by manually entering the date and time details or using the convenient drag-and-drop feature. This feature not only saves time but also improves the overall user experience, allowing bookings to be placed with just a few clicks.

To help differentiate between different types of bookings, the system employs color-coding, so users can instantly identify the nature of each reservation. This visual aid makes managing room schedules even more straightforward. Additionally, the system allows academic staff to efficiently manage both room availability and user access, ensuring that resources are used optimally and that any potential conflicts are minimized.

With this system, we aim to improve the room reservation process, eliminate scheduling clashes, and make booking lecture spaces easier and more efficient for everyone involved. Feel free to use the Faculty of Engineering Room Reservation Systemâ€”making room booking easier, faster, and more organized!
